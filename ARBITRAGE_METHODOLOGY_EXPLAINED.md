## ⚡ **Core Arbitrage Strategies**

### **1. ⏰ TEMPORAL ARBITRAGE - Contract vs Spot Exploitation**

**Strategy:** Exploit differences between fixed contract prices and volatile spot market prices.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Temporal_Profit = Arbitrage_Volume × Price_Spread × Capture_Efficiency

Where:
• Arbitrage_Volume = Daily_Volume × Available_Deviation / 100
• Available_Deviation = max(0, 3% - MAPE)  [Regulatory compliance]
• Price_Spread = |Contract_Price - Actual_Spot_Price|
• Capture_Efficiency = 0.7  [Market friction factor]
```

**Business Logic:**
- **Risk Management**: Only trade within regulatory deviation limits (3%)
- **MAPE Buffer**: Better forecasts = more available trading capacity
- **Market Reality**: 70% capture accounts for transaction costs and timing delays

**Example (1500 GWh Portfolio, 1.5% MAPE):**
```
Daily_Volume = 1500 × 1000 / 365 = 4,110 MWh/day
Available_Deviation = max(0, 3% - 1.5%) = 1.5%
Arbitrage_Volume = 4,110 × 1.5% = 62 MWh

Contract_Price = 420 RMB/MWh
Actual_Spot = 380 RMB/MWh  
Price_Spread = |420 - 380| = 40 RMB/MWh

Temporal_Profit = 62 × 40 × 0.7 = ¥1,736/day
```

### **2. 🤖 AI-ENHANCED ARBITRAGE - ML Prediction-Based Trading**

**Strategy:** Use superior AI price predictions to trade against day-ahead market prices.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
AI_Profit = AI_Volume × Prediction_Spread × AI_Capture_Efficiency

Where:
• AI_Volume = Daily_Volume × 0.8 × Prediction_Accuracy
• Prediction_Accuracy = max(0.1, 1 - MAPE/100)
• Prediction_Spread = |AI_Predicted_Price - Day_Ahead_Price|
• AI_Capture_Efficiency = 0.6  [Competitive market factor]
```

**Business Logic:**
- **Model Confidence Scaling**: Volume proportional to prediction accuracy
- **Conservative Allocation**: Only 80% of portfolio for AI-based strategies
- **Competitive Market**: 60% capture (lower than temporal due to other AI traders)

**Example (1500 GWh Portfolio, 1.5% MAPE):**
```
Daily_Volume = 4,110 MWh/day
Prediction_Accuracy = max(0.1, 1 - 1.5/100) = 0.985 (98.5%)
AI_Volume = 4,110 × 0.8 × 0.985 = 3,238 MWh

AI_Predicted = 385 RMB/MWh
Day_Ahead_Price = 395 RMB/MWh
Prediction_Spread = |385 - 395| = 10 RMB/MWh

AI_Profit = 3,238 × 10 × 0.6 = ¥19,428/day
```

### **3. 📈 PEAK/OFF-PEAK OPTIMIZATION - Time-of-Use Arbitrage**

**Strategy:** Shift flexible demand from peak to off-peak periods based on AI predictions.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
TOU_Profit = Shiftable_Volume × Peak_Valley_Spread × Shift_Efficiency

Where:
• Shiftable_Volume = Daily_Volume × 0.3  [30% flexible industrial load]
• Peak_Valley_Spread = |Peak_Price - Valley_Price|
• Shift_Efficiency = Prediction_Accuracy × 0.8  [Operational constraints]
```

**Business Logic:**
- **Load Flexibility**: Only 30% of industrial load can be time-shifted
- **AI Timing Advantage**: Better predictions enable better timing
- **Physical Constraints**: 80% max efficiency due to operational limitations

**Example (Peak: 450, Valley: 320 RMB/MWh):**
```
Daily_Volume = 4,110 MWh/day
Shiftable_Volume = 4,110 × 0.3 = 1,233 MWh

Peak_Price = 450 RMB/MWh
Valley_Price = 320 RMB/MWh
Peak_Valley_Spread = 450 - 320 = 130 RMB/MWh

Prediction_Accuracy = 0.985
Shift_Efficiency = 0.985 × 0.8 = 0.788

TOU_Profit = 1,233 × 130 × 0.788 = ¥126,418/day
```

### **4. 🌱 RENEWABLE ARBITRAGE - Green Energy Timing**

**Strategy:** Trade based on renewable generation variability affecting market prices.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Renewable_Profit = Renewable_Volume × Price_Impact × Prediction_Accuracy

Where:
• Renewable_Volume = Daily_Volume × 0.4  [40% renewable-sensitive load]
• Price_Impact = Renewable_Std × 0.02  [2% price impact per MW std dev]
• Renewable_Std = Standard deviation of renewable forecasts
```

**Business Logic:**
- **Renewable Sensitivity**: 40% of load can respond to renewable patterns
- **Price Impact Model**: Statistical relationship: 1 MW std dev → 2% price movement
- **Market Efficiency**: Higher renewable variability = more arbitrage opportunities

**Example (Renewable Std = 75 MW):**
```
Daily_Volume = 4,110 MWh/day  
Renewable_Volume = 4,110 × 0.4 = 1,644 MWh

Renewable_Forecast_Std = 75 MW
Price_Impact = 75 × 0.02 = 1.5 RMB/MWh

Prediction_Accuracy = 0.985

Renewable_Profit = 1,644 × 1.5 × 0.985 = ¥2,430/day
```

## 💸 **Cost Components & Risk Management**

### **Penalty Costs (Regulatory Compliance)**
```
Penalty_Cost = Excess_Volume × Contract_Price × Penalty_Rate

Where:
• Excess_Volume = Daily_Volume × max(0, MAPE - 3%) / 100
• Penalty_Rate = 0.1  [10% penalty on regulatory violations]
• Only applies when MAPE > 3% (regulatory deviation limit)
```

**Example (MAPE = 4.5%):**
```
Daily_Volume = 4,110 MWh/day
Excess_Error = max(0, 4.5% - 3%) = 1.5%
Excess_Volume = 4,110 × 1.5% = 62 MWh

Contract_Price = 420 RMB/MWh
Penalty_Rate = 0.1

Penalty_Cost = 62 × 420 × 0.1 = ¥2,604/day
```

### **Operational Costs (AI-Reduced)**
```
Operational_Cost = Base_Cost - AI_Savings

Where:
• Base_Cost = Daily_Volume × MAPE × 1.5  [RMB 1.5/MWh per % MAPE]
• AI_Savings = Base_Cost × 0.3 × Prediction_Accuracy  [30% AI reduction]
```

**Example (1.5% MAPE):**
```
Daily_Volume = 4,110 MWh/day
Base_Cost = 4,110 × 1.5 × 1.5 = ¥9,248/day

Prediction_Accuracy = 0.985
AI_Savings = 9,248 × 0.3 × 0.985 = ¥2,734/day

Operational_Cost = 9,248 - 2,734 = ¥6,514/day
```

---

## 🧮 **Net Profit Calculation**

**Final Formula:**
```
Net_Profit = Total_Arbitrage_Profit - Total_Costs

Where:
• Total_Arbitrage_Profit = Temporal + AI + TOU + Renewable
• Total_Costs = Penalty_Cost + Operational_Cost
```

**Complete Example (1500 GWh, 1.5% MAPE):**
```

• Temporal Arbitrage:    ¥1,736/day
• AI-Enhanced Arbitrage: ¥19,428/day
