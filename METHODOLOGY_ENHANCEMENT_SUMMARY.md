# 🔍 Enhanced Arbitrage Simulator: Methodology Transparency Update

## ✅ **What Was Added: Complete Mathematical Transparency**

### **📚 New "Methodology & Equations" Tab**
Added comprehensive explanation tab with:

1. **⏰ Temporal Arbitrage Formulation**
   ```
   Profit = Volume × |Contract_Price - Spot_Price| × 70%
   Volume = Daily_Volume × (3% - MAPE)/100
   ```

2. **🤖 AI-Enhanced Arbitrage Formulation** 
   ```
   Profit = Volume × |AI_Predicted - Day_Ahead| × 60%
   Volume = Daily_Volume × 0.8 × (1-MAPE/100)
   ```

3. **📈 Peak/Off-peak Optimization**
   ```
   Profit = Shiftable_Volume × Peak_Valley_Spread × Efficiency
   Shiftable_Volume = Daily_Volume × 30%
   ```

4. **🌱 Renewable Arbitrage**
   ```
   Profit = Volume × Price_Impact × Prediction_Accuracy
   Price_Impact = Renewable_Std × 2%
   ```

5. **💸 Cost Components**
   ```
   Penalty = Excess_Volume × Price × 10% (if MAPE > 3%)
   Operational = Base_Cost - AI_Savings
   ```

## 🔑 **Key Equations Summary**

| Strategy | Core Formula | Key Parameters |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Temporal** | `Volume × Spread × 70%` | Volume = f(MAPE), Spread = market |
| **AI-Enhanced** | `Volume × Spread × 60%` | Volume = f(accuracy), Spread = prediction |
| **Peak/Off-peak** | `30% × Spread × Efficiency` | Efficiency = f(accuracy) |
| **Renewable** | `40% × Impact × Accuracy` | Impact = f(renewable_std) |
| **Penalties** | `Excess × Price × 10%` | Excess = max(0, MAPE-3%) |
| **Operational** | `Base - AI_Savings` | Savings = f(accuracy) |
