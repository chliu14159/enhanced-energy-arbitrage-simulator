## Key Data Explained

Understanding a few key data points can help users optimize their electricity costs and manage risk.

### Zonal Marginal Price (South/North Jiangsu)

  * **What it is**: This price reflects the real-time cost of supplying one more unit of electricity in a specific region (e.g., South Jiangsu vs. North Jiangsu). A high price indicates a tight supply-demand balance.
  * **How to use it**: Industrial and commercial users can use this price signal to adjust their production schedules. For example, if the day-ahead price in your zone is forecasted to be very high during certain hours, you could shift energy-intensive operations to cheaper periods to reduce costs.
  * **Example**: An industrial park in North Jiangsu notices that the day-ahead average price in South Jiangsu is ¥580/MWh. It can work with its electricity sales company to reduce its power consumption during that high-priced period.

### New Energy Output: Forecast vs. Actual

  * **What it is**: The market provides forecasts for wind and solar power generation. However, the actual output can differ significantly from the forecast due to changing weather conditions.
  * **Why it matters**: A large discrepancy between forecasted and actual renewable energy output can cause significant real-time price volatility. For instance, if the forecast predicted 1000 MW of wind power but only 500 MW materializes, the system will be short on supply, likely causing the real-time electricity price to spike.
  * **User Strategy**: Users can arrange strategies with their sales companies to automatically reduce load (e.g., temporarily pause non-essential machinery) when real-time prices surge past a certain threshold, protecting them from extreme price events.

### Deviation Assessment Fee Allocation

  * **The Rule**: If a user's actual electricity consumption in a month deviates from their contracted volume by more than **±3%**, they are subject to a financial penalty. This penalty is calculated based on the price difference between their contract and the real-time market price for the deviation amount.
  * **How to check it**: Users can find a detailed breakdown of these deviation charges in the settlement information section of the trading platform. This allows for transparency and helps users understand the financial impact of their consumption patterns. You can filter by your electricity sales company's name to see the specifics.
