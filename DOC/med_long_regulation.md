## Chapter 1: General Provisions

These rules are designed to standardize Jiangsu's medium and long-term electricity trading, protect the rights of market participants, and ensure a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market environment. They apply to all medium and long-term electricity transactions conducted within Jiangsu province.

A **medium and long-term transaction** is defined as any electricity or energy trade conducted between market participants (generation companies, users, sales companies, etc.) for a period of a day or longer (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, multi-year). These transactions are carried out through methods like bilateral negotiation, centralized bidding, and listing.

## Chapter 2: Market Members

### Definitions

* **Market Members**: Include generation companies, electricity sales companies, electricity users, grid enterprises, the power trading institution (Jiangsu Electric Power Trading Center), the power dispatch institution (Jiangsu Power Dispatch Control Center), and energy storage companies.
* **Electricity Users**: Are divided into two categories:
    * **Type 1 Users (Wholesale)**: Participate directly in the wholesale market, purchasing electricity from generation companies.
    * **Type 2 Users (Retail)**: Purchase electricity from electricity sales companies.

### Rights and Obligations

Each market member has specific rights and obligations to ensure the fair and orderly functioning of the market.

* **Generation Companies**:
    * Right to participate in transactions and receive fair transmission service.
    * Obligation to fulfill contracts, obey unified grid dispatch, and disclose required information.
* **Electricity Users**:
    * Right to choose their trading partners and methods, and to receive fair transmission service.
    * Obligation to fulfill contracts, pay all associated fees (electricity, transmission, surcharges, etc.), and follow dispatch instructions during grid emergencies.
* **Electricity Sales Companies**:
    * Right to participate in wholesale trading and sell electricity across the province.
    * Obligation to provide performance guarantees, complete settlements, and protect user information.
* **Grid Enterprises**:
    * Right to charge for transmission, distribution, and other system fees.
    * Obligation to ensure grid safety, provide non-discriminatory grid access, offer default electricity supply services (agent purchasing), and provide necessary data for market operations.

### Market Entry and Exit

* **Entry**: To participate, entities must generally be legal persons, financially independent, and have a good credit record.
    * **Generators**: Must have the appropriate licenses and meet environmental standards.
    * **Users**: All industrial and commercial users are principally included. Users with a voltage level of 35kV or higher can choose to be Type 1 or Type 2; others must be Type 2.
    * **Sales Companies**: Must provide a performance guarantee based on their transaction volume.
* **Exit**:
    * **Voluntary Exit**: A sales company can voluntarily exit after all its contracts are fulfilled or transferred.
    * **Forced Exit**: An entity can be forced to exit for severe violations, such as providing false materials, malicious market disruption, or major contract defaults. A forced-out entity and its legal representative are barred from re-entry for three years. The electricity price for a forced-out user is set at **1.5 times** the grid agent's purchasing price.

## Chapter 3: Market Registration, Change, and Cancellation

* **Registration**: All market participants must register on the Jiangsu Electric Power Trading Platform using their unified social credit code. Registration requires submitting detailed information about the business, its assets, and its technical capabilities. For sales companies, this information is made public for a comment period before registration becomes effective.
* **Information Changes**: Participants must promptly update their registration information if significant changes occur (e.g., change in legal person, major shareholders).
* **Cancellation (Deregistration)**: Entities exiting the market must apply for cancellation. The trading institution will process the cancellation after all contractual obligations have been settled. Providing false registration materials will result in the responsible party bearing all resulting losses.

## Chapter 4: Trading Varieties and Methods

### Trading Varieties

The main types of transactions include:
1.  **Energy Trading**: The standard purchase and sale of electricity between generators and buyers (users/sales companies).
2.  **Generation Rights Trading**: A transaction where one generation company transfers its contracted baseline electricity volume to another.
3.  **Contract Transfer Trading**: A wholesale market transaction where a participant transfers their existing contract (either for generation or purchase) to another wholesale participant. This allows for flexibility after initial contracts are signed.

### Trading Methods

Transactions can be organized across various timeframes (annual, monthly, intra-month) and use the following methods:
1.  **Bilateral Negotiation**: Two parties privately negotiate the price and volume of electricity and submit the agreement to the trading platform.
2.  **Centralized Bidding**: Participants submit anonymous price and volume bids to the trading platform. The platform then clears the market to determine the matched trades and a unified clearing price. This can be done via a **marginal price** (all trades clear at the price of the last matched bid) or **pay-as-bid/high-low matching** (each trade clears at the average of the buyer's and seller's bids).
3.  **Listing (or 掛牌交易)**: One party posts a buy or sell offer (price and volume) on the platform, and another party can "take" (摘牌) that offer to complete the trade. This also includes a continuous "rolling matchmaking" format.

## Chapter 5: Price Mechanism

* **Price Formation**: Market transaction prices are formed within a "benchmark price + upward/downward float" range, as determined by national regulations.
* **Price Limits**: While bilateral negotiations are generally not price-limited, centralized bidding includes price caps and floors to prevent market manipulation and malicious competition.
* **User Settlement Price**: The final price a user pays is a sum of several components:
    1.  **Transaction Price**: The energy price from the market trade.
    2.  **Transmission and Distribution Price**: The regulated fee for using the grid.
    3.  **Line Loss Charges**: The cost of electricity lost during transmission.
    4.  **System Operation Fees**: Includes charges for ancillary services.
    5.  **Government Funds and Surcharges**: Levies mandated by the government.
* **Special Cases**:
    * Users who previously participated in the market but then opt for the grid agent's purchasing service will pay **1.5 times** the agent's standard price.

## Chapter 6: Trading Organization

The power trading institution organizes all market transactions based on published announcements.

* **Trading Announcements**: Before any trading session, an announcement is published detailing the trading period, participants, total volume, bidding times, clearing method, and any grid constraints.
* **Trading Cycles**:
    * **Annual (and Multi-Year) Trading**: Primarily uses bilateral negotiation and listing. Aims to secure a baseline of electricity supply and demand for the coming year(s).
    * **Monthly (and Multi-Month) Trading**: Primarily uses centralized bidding to adjust plans closer to the delivery period.
    * **Intra-Month Trading (Daily, Weekly, etc.)**: Uses centralized bidding and listing to allow for fine-tuning of positions as real-time conditions become clearer.

---

## Chapter 7: Security Check

All transaction results are subject to a security check by the power dispatch institution.

* **Purpose**: To ensure that the electricity flows resulting from the trades will not violate the physical limits of the transmission grid or compromise system safety.
* **Process**: The trading institution submits the preliminary results of all transactions (bilateral, centralized, etc.) to the dispatch institution. The dispatch institution performs a power flow analysis against known constraints (e.g., line capacities, planned maintenance).
* **Curtailment**: If a security check fails (i.e., a trade would cause a grid overload), the transaction volumes are curtailed. The rules specify the priority for curtailment (e.g., centralized trades are curtailed before those with specific power curves; trades are curtailed based on price or time priority).

---

## Chapter 8: Contract Signing and Execution

* **Contract Formation**: All trades must be formalized in a contract. Electronically confirmed results on the trading platform are considered legally binding electronic contracts, equivalent to paper contracts.
* **Contract Content**: Contracts must clearly define the parties, volume, price, execution period, settlement method, and responsibilities for deviations.
* **Contract Execution**: The dispatch institution arranges grid operation to facilitate the execution of cleared contracts. Parties can mutually agree to adjust the monthly delivery schedule of their annual contracts, provided it passes a new security check.

---

## Chapter 9: Metering and Settlement

This chapter details the financial settlement of all transactions.

### Metering

* Grid enterprises are responsible for installing and reading meters that meet technical standards.
* Metering data must be collected and submitted to the trading institution promptly to enable settlement.

### Settlement

* **Process**: The trading institution issues monthly settlement statements based on contract terms and actual metered data. The grid enterprise remains the central entity for billing and payment; users pay the grid company, and the grid company pays generators.
* **User Bill**: A user's bill will clearly itemize the different cost components (market energy price, T&D price, line losses, etc.).

### Deviation Settlement

Deviations between contracted electricity volume and actual usage are financially settled. This is a critical mechanism for ensuring market balance.

* **User-Side Deviations**:
    * A tolerance band of **±3%** is applied to the total monthly contract volume for Type 1 users and sales companies.
    * **Over-consumption**: Usage above the contract volume but within the 3% band is settled at the user's weighted average contract price. Usage exceeding the +3% threshold is settled at the *upper limit* of the market price range for that period.
    * **Under-consumption**: If actual usage is below the contract volume, the settlement is based on the contract terms.
    * A separate **deviation adjustment fee** (10% of the benchmark price) is charged on deviations exceeding the 3% band.
* **Generator-Side Deviations**:
    * A generator's deviation is the difference between its actual generation and its net contract position.
    * These deviations are settled based on a calculated **over-generation price** or **under-generation price**. These prices are determined by taking the minimum or maximum of various market reference prices (e.g., centralized bidding price, listing price) and applying a factor 'K'.
    * The factor **'K'** adjusts based on the monthly average price of coal, ranging from 0.90 to 1.0, to reflect fuel cost pressures.
    * A deviation adjustment fee is also applied to generators if their deviation exceeds a 2% tolerance band due to their own reasons.

## Chapter 10: Information Disclosure

Transparency is maintained through a three-tiered information system.

1.  **Public Information**: Available to the general public (e.g., market rules, electricity pricing policies, aggregated market data).
2.  **Market Open Information**: Available to all registered market participants (e.g., list of participants, transmission line capacity, overall transaction volumes and prices, grid maintenance plans).
3.  **Private Information**: Available only to the specific entity (e.g., their own bids and detailed transaction data, individual settlement statements).

The trading and dispatch institutions are responsible for managing the disclosure platform and ensuring information is provided in a timely, accurate, and non-discriminatory manner.

---

## Chapter 11: Market Monitoring and Risk Prevention

* **Monitoring**: The trading and dispatch institutions continuously monitor market operations to prevent risks and ensure fairness.
* **Market Intervention**: In extraordinary circumstances, the market can be suspended. This may occur due to:
    * Major grid accidents threatening safety.
    * Malicious market manipulation that severely distorts results.
    * Major failure of the trading system's technical platform.
    * Force majeure events.
    * Emergency declarations by the government.
* During a market suspension, dispatch may revert to an administrative, command-and-control mode to ensure supply security.

---

## Chapter 12: Disputes and Violation Handling

* **Disputes**: A formal process is defined for resolving disputes between participants regarding registration, transactions, or settlement. The steps are:
    1.  Negotiation.
    2.  Mediation or adjudication.
    3.  Arbitration.
    4.  Judicial proceedings.
* **Violations**: Actions such as providing false information, abusing market power, colluding, or failing to settle payments are considered violations. The energy regulatory office will handle these according to relevant laws, which can lead to warnings, fines, or forced exit from the market.
