## Phase 2: Core Trading Operations (Months 4-12)

### 2.1 Procurement Strategy: Multi-Timeframe Approach

#### A. Medium/Long-Term Contracts (80% of volume)
- **Strategy**: Secure 80% of expected annual demand through annual contracts
- **Method**: Bilateral negotiation for baseload, centralized bidding for incremental
- **Target Price**: Benchmark price minus 3-5% for competitive advantage
- **Profit Margin**: 8-12% markup to customers (after T&D charges)

#### B. Monthly Optimization (15% of volume)
- **Strategy**: Use monthly centralized bidding to adjust positions
- **Key Insight**: Coal price fluctuations affect factor 'K' (0.90-1.0) in deviation pricing
- **Tactical Approach**: Increase purchases when coal prices drop, reduce when they rise

#### C. Spot Market Trading (5% of volume)
- **Day-Ahead Strategy**: Submit demand bids at zonal marginal price forecasts
- **Real-Time Management**: Minimize deviations through demand response programs
- **Target**: Stay within ±3% deviation band to avoid penalty fees

### 2.2 Revenue Optimization Strategies

#### A. Zonal Arbitrage
- **Opportunity**: Price differences between South Jiangsu (industrial) and North Jiangsu (rural)
- **Strategy**: Position customers in lower-cost zones, sell to higher-priced zones
- **Expected Profit**: 10-30 ¥/MWh from zonal spreads

#### B. Time-of-Use Optimization
- **Method**: Analyze 96-point pricing patterns to identify low-cost periods
- **Customer Value**: Offer time-of-use contracts with demand response incentives
- **Technology**: Smart metering and automated load control systems
- **Revenue**: 50-100 ¥/MWh premium for flexible customers

#### C. Renewable Energy Forecasting Edge
- **Challenge**: New energy forecast errors cause price volatility
- **Solution**: Develop superior wind/solar forecasting models
- **Competitive Advantage**: Better prediction = better positioning in day-ahead market
- **Expected ROI**: 15-25% improvement in trading accuracy
