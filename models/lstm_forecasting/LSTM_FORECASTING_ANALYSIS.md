## 🎯 Model Performance Results

### 🌪️ **Wind Generation Models**

| Station | Type | MAE (MW) | RMSE (MW) | MAPE (%) | R² Score | Status |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **501974** | Wind | 581.5 | 790.5 | 80,287.6* | 0.956 | ✅ Excellent |
| **506445** | Wind | 413.2 | 508.9 | 21.4 | 0.980 | ✅ Outstanding |
| **Average** | Wind | 497.4 | 649.7 | - | 0.968 | ✅ Very Strong |

### ☀️ **Solar Generation Models**

| Station | Type | MAE (MW) | RMSE (MW) | MAPE (%) | R² Score | Status |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **502633** | Solar | 479.3 | 566.9 | High* | 0.997 | ✅ Near-Perfect |
| **505519** | Solar | - | - | - | - | ❌ Data Issues |

*Note: High MAPE values are due to zero/near-zero actual values during nighttime for solar and low wind periods, making percentage errors extremely large. The absolute errors (MAE/RMSE) and R² scores are the reliable metrics.*
